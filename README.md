R code for Bachelor Thesis: Identifying strip cropping fields in the Netherlands: A study of the relationship between spatial and temporal diversity in strip cropping fields

# The code given in this repository serves as way of understanding the coding behind the analysis in my thesis.
this repository does not contain all coding used, I left out most coding that deals with data shaping needed before starting any coding.
The three files here show the most important aspects of this research: 1). Identifying strip cropping fields (subsetting stripcropping2), 2). Identifying temporal crop rotations (crop_rotations_temporal) and 3). The data analysis (Data analysis).
