R code for Bachelor Thesis: Identifying strip cropping fields in the Netherlands: A study of the relationship between spatial and temporal diversity in strip cropping fields

The code given in this repository serves as way of understanding the coding behind the analysis in my thesis.
this repository does not contain all coding used, I left out most coding that deals with data shaping needed before starting any coding.
The three files here show the most important aspects of this research: 1). Identifying strip cropping fields (subsetting stripcropping2), 2). Identifying temporal crop rotations (crop_rotations_temporal) and 3). The data analysis (Data analysis).

Also present in this repository are most starting files for needed to perform the scripts. These can be seen in the code when loading in the data. A few files are missing. These are provinciegrenzen files, which can be found hereL: https://www.pdok.nl/introductie/-/article/bestuurlijke-grenzen
Apart from these, the starting files of which we gather data are the BRPgewaspercelen files of every year from 2009 to 2023. Online, only the current year of data is available here: https://service.pdok.nl/rvo/brpgewaspercelen/atom/v1_0/index.xml
The rest should be obtained through your institution. 

Given this most code should speak for itself, although sometimes not veyr structered.
